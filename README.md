# Cartpole-v1-Reinforcement-Learning
Task: The goal of this project is to perform Q-Learning & Deep-Q Learning on the agent in the CartPole-v1 gym environment.


PART 1: Implement the Q-Learning Reinforcement Learning Algorithm on CartPole-v1 environment
        > a. Display the performance of the random agent
        > b. Compare the performance of the random agent to the RL-Agent.


PART 2: Implement the Deep-Q Network Algorithm using Keras RL library on CartPole-v1 environment.
        > a. Display the performance of the random agent
        > b. Compare the performance of the random agent to the RL-Agent.
